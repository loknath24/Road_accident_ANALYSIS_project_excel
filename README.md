# Road_accident_ANALYSIS_project_excel
* A dashboard with  detailed analysis of the Road accidents over a time period in UK.
* Data cleaning using filters, eliminating Nulls ,changing the data type and creating a clean dataset
* 2 year month-wise casuality trend using line graphs 
* Analyzing the casuality proportion based on Road type,road surface,by area,by light conditions.
* An interactive dashboard with added slicers to filter yearwise,monthwise and rural area wise.

  # overview - The objective of this project is to create a Road Accident Dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022. The dashboard aims to provide insights into several key performance indicators (KPIs) related to road accidents, including total casualties, total accidents, and their YoY growth rates.
The primary KPIs include the total casualties and total accidents for the current year and their YoY growth rates, as well as the total casualties by accident severity for the current year and YoY growth rates. Additionally, the dashboard will provide secondary KPIs that show the total casualties with respect to vehicle type for the current year.
The dashboard will also include a monthly trend chart that compares the casualties for the current year and the previous year. Moreover, it will showcase casualties by road type for the current year, as well as current year casualties by area/location and by day/night. Finally, the dashboard will provide total casualties and total accidents by location, which can help identify hotspots and patterns in road accidents.
Overall, this Road Accident Dashboard will be an essential tool for stakeholders in the transportation industry and the government, helping them to gain insights into road accident trends, identify risk factors, and devise targeted strategies to reduce road accidents.
